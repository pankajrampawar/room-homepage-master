- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

I made this app using react and some components are written in react states and i witnessed one of the major issues with react for second time and that is waterfalling, there is a white flash for a second and for that I need to shift this app to next.js and also i want to learn how to do preloading in react.
